# Fake AFK
Allows players to create fake players from [Carpet Mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/carpet) without significantly changing the games balance

The mod only needs to exist server-side, and it requires Carpet Mod to work

## Commands

`/afk:ready` after running, a Fake Player will be created at your position when you log off, and disappear once you log back on

`/afk:summon` summons your Fake Player for 5 minutes, so you can give it items, or kill it to get any items it picked up - the limited time means some simple tasks that require two people can be done, but anything complex cant

`/afk:name` rename your Fake Player, all names need to include a "-", which regular usernames can't, so its always clear who is a real player
